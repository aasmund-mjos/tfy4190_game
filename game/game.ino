// Most of the signal pins are configurable, but the CLK pin has some
// special constraints.  On 8-bit AVR boards it must be on PORTB...
// Pin 11 works on the Arduino Mega.  On 32-bit SAMD boards it must be
// on the same PORT as the RGB data pins (D2-D7)...
// Pin 8 works on the Adafruit Metro M0 or Arduino Zero,
// Pin A4 works on the Adafruit Metro M4 (if using the Adafruit RGB
// Matrix Shield, cut trace between CLK pads and run a wire to A4).
